The top of the pyramid is built by adding building blocks from the bottom. Similarly, the basic layer of the front-end consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
HTML determines the structure of the web page, just like a house contains a living room, bedroom, bathroom, etc.
CSS determines the style of the web page, such as white kitchen walls and pink bedroom walls.
The most amazing part is JavaScript. It can make the house fully functional, such as turning on the lights or boiling water through an outlet. Thus, JavaScript allows you to implement complex features on a website.
After learning the basics mentioned above, you can already make a web page. However, if you want to enhance the user experience, you need to learn more.
React is a JavaScript library built on top of JavaScript, which brings several advantages to web developers. For example, React is used to build single-page applications, which make websites faster and provide better user experiences. React can also create reusable UI components, allowing you to build a website like Lego blocks. React introduced JSX, which allows you to use HTML and JavaScript together.
Furthermore, React itself is continuously evolving, from one-way data flow at the beginning to centralized state management, which makes it easier for developers to manage state (which will be discussed in the next blog).
The purpose of technology development is to make things easier. As people become more accustomed to using reusable components, more CSS libraries like Styled-components are created. Styled-components are not only reusable but also allow you to write CSS in JavaScript.
In conclusion, as time goes on, technology will continue to evolve rapidly, but they will all be developed based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
