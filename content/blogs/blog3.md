Front-end development is a rapidly growing field with various frameworks, libraries, and development tools. It can be overwhelming for beginners to know where to start. The following tips are the methods that I use to improve my front-end learning efficiency, and I hope they can be helpful for you as well.

&nbsp;

### **1. Make a plan**

Before you start learning front-end knowledge, you need to understand what skills a front-end developer must have. You may ask where can I get this information? I suggest you to browser the roadmap website, here is the link for the website: [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend). You will see there are lots of new stuffs be waiting for us, so the next step is you need to make a plan, and don’t forget to give yourself a deadline, it will push your learning progress.

### **2. How to learn?**

As a beginner, it is hard to learn a new skill because you will face lots of difficulties and questions all the time, but don’t give up at this stage, because there are many ways to help you to solve your doubts. Please always remember that the problem you have en-countered must have been encountered by others. So, once you had any questions, you can google them. Normally if I learn a new thing, I will read the official document first and will also read some related blogs to help me deepen my understanding of what I’ve learned.

However, only read documents sometimes make you feel knowledge can be forgotten easily; front-end developer skill also needs to be strengthened through continuous prac-tice. Keeping coding is another way to help you remember knowledge and you can code faster and faster.

Meanwhile, review is also important. We can draw diagram to help us understanding what we learned, sometimes write a blog is also a good way for us to review knowledge.

### **3. Suggestion study tools or websites:**

- Notion: I use Notion app as my note book, I feel this app is very convivence to making reading notes.
- CodePen: it is an online coding environment, if you have any ideas and you want to see result immediately, you can have a try in the CodePen.

- github: you can find some good projects in the github, and have a look how other developer coding.
