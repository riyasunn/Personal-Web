The top of the pyramid is built by adding building blocks from the bottom. Similarly, in modern web development, the foundation of front-end development is built upon three pillars: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML provides the structure of a webpage, just like a house containing a living room, bedroom, bathroom, and so on. CSS determines the style of the web page, such as white kitchen walls and pink bedroom walls. The most amazing part is JavaScript, it adds functionality to the webpage, allowing it to respond dynamically to user interactions; to follow the example above, it can make the house fully functional, such as you can turn on the lights or boil water in this house.

However, to enhance the user experience, additional knowledge is required, this is where React and JavaScript library comes in.

React brings several advantages to web developers. For example, React simplifies the development of single-page applications, which makes the website faster and provides better user experiences. React enables developers to create reusable UI components, which makes developers build a website as easy as playing with Lego blocks. JSX also introduced by React, allows developers to use HTML and JavaScript together.

As React evolves, it continues to introduce new features, such as centralized state management, which simplifies the control of an application's state.

In conclusion, the purpose of technology development is to make things easier, no matter how web technology evolves, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will remain the fundamental building blocks of front-end development.
